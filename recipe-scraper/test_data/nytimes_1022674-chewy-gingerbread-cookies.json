  "description": "This gingerbread is maxed out on spice, packed with two types of fiery ginger and lots of prickly black pepper. Cozy from all the warm spices as well as from molasses, they’re perfect for munching on while tree-trimming. The center of the cookie is fudgy and dense, while the outside edges stay crisp — like the best brownie, but in gingerbread form. That chewy-crispy texture is thanks to the confectioners’ sugar in the dough and a light coating of ginger-spiced sugar. Be sure to use true molasses and not blackstrap molasses; blackstrap molasses has less sugar, more salt and acidity, and can change the way the dough browns, spreads and interacts with the leavening.",

Cookies were extremely runny/spready at first (maybe because I didn’t let the butter cool enough, based on other comments) and also were very quickly getting bubbly &amp; lacey @ 350. To fix, I used *very* small scoops of dough (about 1 tbsp, 2+ in apart) and I turned the oven down to 300 — they cooked slowly, and instead of the chewy centers, this resulted in a beautifully crispy, light melt-in-your-mouth texture.
