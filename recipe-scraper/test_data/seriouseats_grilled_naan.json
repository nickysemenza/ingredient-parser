Flip with a large spatula, pizza peel, or with tongs and cook until second side is charred and browned. Remove naan from the grill and immediately brush with melted butter.

In any dough, water is needed for gluten to form which is what's going to provide structure and consistency. Thus, with less water per volume, you'd need to use a greater volume of greek yogurt to achieve similar dough hydration / gluten."

      "reviewBody": "The first time I made this, I used only some homemade \"greek\" yogurt that, admittedly, was practically labneh. It must have been far too thick because I had to add a huge amount of milk to get the dough even close to being sticky. The second time, I thinned my yogurt significantly with whole milk until it was the consistency of buttermilk, and of course used a scale for all measurements. This is such a stiff dough! My artisan model stand mixer can't handle it! I can't figure out what I'm doing wrong here. I did scale the recipe down by 1/2 both times, so it's 11 oz flour to 7 oz yogurt/milk mixture. I'm using the central milling 'high mountain' flour which is 13.5% protein content. \n\nKneading it for 15 minutes or so in the mixer does create a cohesive ball, but it doesn't look anything like Kenji's images of a sticky batter-like dough. Last time I kept adding liquid until it looked similar and it turned out okay (though it did burn really quickly in the ooni), so maybe this time I'll try not adding liquid and see how it compares."
