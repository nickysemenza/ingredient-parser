I think it was in there for a week, and was delicious. Topped with meatballs and pepperoni. My husband said it was the most attractive and tasty pizza he's ever eaten.\n\nAlso, could the serious eats team work on a way to search through the comments? I can tell that Kenji gets somewhat annoyed when the same question is asked over and over, but who has time to go through 18 pages of comments to see if their question has been answered previously? Smitten Kitchen and King Arthur Flour both have comment search bars that are extremely helpful if you need an example."

I've been looking for something that I can easily replicate the same way time again. \n\nSince I didn't have the luxury of waiting 8 hours for the bulk rise (who am I kidding, I was just hungry), I added 25g of raspberry honey to the 275g warm water. No instant yeast, but used 8g active dry yeast (which was approximately 2 1/4 tsp), and stirred that into the honey mix to bloom. \n\nLeft to rise in the same bowl about 3.5 hours (warm kitchen) and divided the dough. Pressed one well oiled ball into a 10\" cast iron and pressed out the other into a 1/4 size heavy duty sheet pan. I left those in my cool oven to rise for another 2 hours or so. The dough in the skillet completely filled the pan. Pressed down gently with my fingers on both.\n\nSmothered each just as the recipe says in sauce and cheese edge to edge and baked in a screaming hot oven for 17~ minutes. The sheet pan one was crispy and divine! Cast iron needed just another 2-3 minutes on medium heat on the stove top to get that full golden brown. Nothing beats a crust of pure crispy cheese.\n\nYum!!\n\n<a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/Z2XKCCZ/MVIMG-20200808-210252.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cat Iron Pizza Top</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/KDyFWXT/MVIMG-20200808-210242.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Cast Iron Pizza Side</a>\n\n<a href=\"https://i.ibb.co/wdfmXDX/MVIMG-20200808-210710.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow ugc\">Pizza Plated</a>"

        "reviewBody": "I had two challenges with this recipe: dough sticking to the pan and the top cooking much faster than the bottom requiring a stove top finish. I've finally resolved both issues. BTW I cook the pizzas in 10\" heavy duty aluminum cake tins- not in a cast iron skillet. Each pizza is cooked at 550 F on a baking stone placed on the rack at the lowest level. The clue to the dough sticking problem was found in Ken Forkish \"The Elements of Pizza\" where he mentioned that dough sitting in oil absorbed most of it and allowed it to stick. To minimize this issue, I allow the two dough balls to rise on separate dinner plates slicked with olive oil, cover with Saran, and flatten by hand. Just before baking, I transfer the dough to the pan that's prepared per Kenji's recipe. This minimizes the extent to which the dough soaks up the oil applied to the pan. The second problem was the crust not getting completely cooked by the time the top was browned, requiring a stove top finish. The solution here was to cook the pizza for 10' at 550 F, then cover with foil, and cook another 10'. After 20' the crust is an even light golden color and the top is not overcooked."

I make the stupidly easiest pizza dough ever. We cook it in cast iron pans in a wood fired oven. It is shockingly delicious - we shovel crusty, melty, soft golden slices into our faces. Husband now worships me as a pizza goddess. Without one tweak or adjustment, it is now a beloved favorite. I was skeptical about the \"2 tbs oil\" in the pan. I was wrong.
